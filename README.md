Question
Make a simple todo app with reactJS, just need two features in the app 
To add/edit/delete a todo
To display a list all todo

Few things to keep in mind
When we add a todo, it should get added via the keyboards ENTER button as well, not just clicking on the add button.
If you know how to use localStorage and can persist todo so that when we refresh the page, all my todo lists are still there that would be great. 

Question 2
Use this page https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2  and display a list of users.
This api works page wise i.e page1, 2, etc. So there should be a similar paging in our app.  Important to not that the number of pages are not fixed to 2, but its dynamic so paging should be dynamic as well
